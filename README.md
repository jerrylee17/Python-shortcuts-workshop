# Python Shortcuts Workshop
This Jupyter Notebook file was made to help me teach a 
Python shortcuts workshop on February 4, 2019.
This workshop is part of the SCE Data Structures and Algorithms
series. Although this tutorial does not introduce any new 
data structures or algorithms, it prepares one to use Python in a more
concise manner and cleans up the code.

## To run on your browser:
1. Go to [NB Viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)
1. Paste in the repo name `jerrylee17/Python-shortcuts-workshop`
1. Click on the `.ipynb` file.
1. Open the file with Binder, by clicking the 3 circles.

Done! The notebook should load shortly, where you can follow my tutorial.
